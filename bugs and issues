can't undo or redo colors, labels, or edge adding

doubling effect of value change // fixed

when you change a shape it changes the color back to white. when you change a color it changes the shape back to ellipse

if you turn an edge black the font turns white

features tba:
    when i select a node, the color/shape selection is set to the node's current color/shape and then changing the dropdown changes the node
        - if multiple nodes are selected, the selection is set to nothing and changing the dropdown changes all the nodes' colors/shapes
    load graph from json

better "save as" json and png

undefined when you try to change both shape and color at same time (i think because when there's a removed color, then there's no more element in array[1])
